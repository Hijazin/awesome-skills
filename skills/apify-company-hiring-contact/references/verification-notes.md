# Verification notes — 2026-10-08

This contribution routes only the author's two existing public Actors. It does not publish a new Actor or change a price.

## Checked evidence

- Read-only public metadata on 2026-10-08 confirmed both routed Actors are public and not deprecated. Fresh read-only public metadata at 03:18 UTC confirmed successful default builds `2.0.17` (Hiring) and `0.2.1` (Contact), expected single-event PPE pricing of $0.03/$0.01, and no platform-usage passthrough enabled. Omitted optional API fields were not recorded as literal affirmative flags.
- Current hosted MCP `tools/list` at 03:13 UTC was used to validate the four argument templates in `mcp-calls.json`: two metadata inspections and two capped Actor calls. Listing tools did not execute them. Execution/storage tool schemas required authentication; anonymous discovery worked separately.
- Both unmodified archived report objects in `output-examples.json` passed the corresponding local JSON Schema. The example inputs and call arguments passed schema checks offline. These checks validate structure and example integrity, not current source content or a deployed execution.
- Archived reports came from owner-funded cloud checks on 2026-10-04. Hiring returned four Linear jobs with Ashby `last_published` evidence; Contact returned five observed signals at Clinique Alpa with incomplete coverage. They do not establish current results, precision across other companies, customer purchases, or profit. Contact's archived report has `billing_event: null` and `billing_quantity: 0`; it is not a settled debit record.
- Anonymous MCP discovery at 03:07 UTC returned Hiring fifth for `company job openings` (limit 10). Neither owned service appeared in the top ten for `hiring signals`; Contact was absent from the nine returned for `website contact`. This is one observed search result set, not a stable ranking or independent agent adoption.

## Remaining limits

No fresh paid end-to-end execution was run for this contribution. Funding, billing settlement, cross-client execution compatibility and third-party agent adoption remain unverified. The host agent supplies persistent reservations; the skill does not implement a ledger, scheduler or payment gateway. The private development portfolio is outside this skill.

Later local source-handling fixes exist, but are not represented as deployed fixes in the pinned public builds. Coverage depends on accessible public source material and supported adapters. A primary-source link improves traceability; it does not guarantee exhaustive company coverage or a correct inference about purchase intent.
